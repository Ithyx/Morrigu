# Morrigu

Morrigu is getting through a complete re-write on this branch.
The main brach was becoming bloated and very hard to maintain end add new features to.

This will now follow the [vkguide](https://vkguide.dev/), at least for now to get a good
idea of what an expandable vulkan renderer architecture looks like.

This branch will probably never be as feature complete as the main branch currently is,
but it will hopefully be a good learning experience.
